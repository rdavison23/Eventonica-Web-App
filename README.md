# Eventonica

Full‑Stack Events Manager week 9

Eventonica is a full‑stack CRUD application for managing events.
It includes a React frontend with client‑side routing and reducer‑based state management, and a Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL backend that exposes a REST API.

This project demonstrates clean architecture, modern React patterns, and a fully functional API layer.
